Last weekend I played solo through the adventure _Death House_ from Curse of Stahd. I‘d like to share some of the tweaks that made it more enjoyable and balanced for solo play.

###Bring Some Backup&hellip;
If, like I did, you start Death House at level one, you’ll want some additional NPCs to round out your party. My favorite combo for solo play these days is a PC (you), a Sidekick, and an Animal Companion. Having a party of three spreads out the damage and balances the action econony to where it's close to a ’normal‘ feel for D&D. 

Bumping a single player to level three or four seems like it should work, but having a single action plus maybe a bonus action or reaction, doesn’t match having even a small party. And while rolling up additional characters seems like it could be great, Sidekicks and Animal Companions seem to work better for solo or one-on-one play, since they are simple stat blocks and have at most a handful of options, which makes them feel appropriately like secondary figures to your hero PC.

If you are playing a melee class (I was playing a Paladin), a Warrior or Expert Sidekick — available on D&D Beyond via the [Dragon’s of Icespire Peak adventure](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/doip) — makes a good buddy. I initially liked the Expert, which can perform Help as a bonus action, but found the Warrior, which gives enemies disadvantage to hit you, almost as good as a debuff with better damage output. Plus, I think you may want your solo PC to be the face of the party, where adding an Expert makes a bit less sense. I haven’t tried the Spellcaster Sidekick yet, but I’m guessing if you wanted to play a straight-up Fighter or Barbarian, you might want a Healer Spellcaster as a party NPC.

As for the Animal Companion, I went with a Wolf reskinned as a dog. I followed the rules outlined in the [Unearthed Arcana](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_RevisedRanger.pdf) for Ranger Animal Companions that can level up with you. I really enjoyed having a Unicorn join my party when playing through Descent Into Avernus, so I’m hoping the dog fits a similar bill in terms of a simple extra party member that still leaves room to add a more complex NPC as a temporary party member later during the adventure. 


###&hellip;Or Find Some Backup Quickly
In my first playthrough of _Death House_ I decided to add Rose as a party member (making Rose and Thorn actual ghosts in the first scene). Having a party of two — the PC and Rose — worked really well and I only almost died one time (more on that in a bit). That said, when I played through it a second time with a Sidekick and an Animal Companion instead of the Ghost, it felt a lot more balanced. I also think it would be cool to have one of the Ghosts posess your Sidekick when they do encounter the Ghosts in the attick: having your understudy suddenly turn super fearfull or agressive would make for an intersting social interaction.

###Reduce the Number of Shadows in Area 31
The main thing to tweak for solo play in this adventure is the number of Shadows in Area 31. As written, there are five Shadows and I found it way too hard, narrowly surviving during my first playthrough and a TPK during my second. With Rose or Thorn as party members you are basically toast, since the Shadows are immune to necrotic damage. Even with a Sidekick and Animal Companion, the Strength drain — which might even be a dump stat — along with resistance to non-magical damage can make for a short and painful encounter.

I recommend reducing the number of Shadows to be equal to the number of party members, so in the suggested party of a PC, Sidekick, and Animal Companion: three.

###Add Something Else "Alive" 
The Shambling Mound encounter is fifty-fifty with the three-creature party described above, and you aren’t supposed to necessarily _have_ to fight it. But, to avoid combat you need to make a living sacrifice. You may want to allow an ’out‘ if the battle is going poorly and let the party sacrifice something before or even during combat with the 136 HP monster. Sacrificing your Sidekick or Animal Companion is probably not going to feel great, so having another ’living creature’ to sacrifice would be nice. In my first runthrough, I decided that burrying Rose’s bones counted as a sacrifice, but you could consider something like the Gertruda’s Dog encounter [as described on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8sfpkn/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_part_2_entering/), which can make for a nice, semi-tragic ending. 

Another option would be to reduce the Mound’s hit points to 64, which makes it more manageable, although I like the idea that the final boss is out of reach. The PC can always come back and clear the basement as part of a later mansion rennovation.

###Listen to a soundtrack
My playthrough lasted a bit under three hours, and [a macabre soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOTyzCntzJo) was a perfect fit. When playing solo, immersing yourself in the sights, smells, and sounds of the adventure is something you can lean into. 


_Death House_ is a highly regarded starter adventure, and (other than the Shadows) it works great as a solo adventure. Hopefully the suggested tweaks make your playthrough as enjoyable as mine were.
